  <p class="p-especial">
    Why does this flaw have an impact?

     This flaw allows you to infect not just one URL
     and yes, all the urls found from /job/.... leading to infection and mass of these urls that allow sending this data directly to employees on a large scale, this is 
     completely out of the control of humans operating the machine after injecting the payload via a file SVG with infected scripts, malware, viruses, and 
     Trojans taking control of the total system and compromising it directly if the file is sent when completing the registration carrying a virus 
     (directly on the CV) that will be opened by employees with computers with completely private access to people special needs to be evaluated, leading to the theft, kidnapping and breaking of this data due to lack of verification and format protection. data that keeps the application alive. It is very necessary to eliminate SVG file entries in CVs from the application and introduce safer formats that do not allow entry of codes such as PDF, Word, among others, which are much safer and do not execute commands and algorithms. 
     I tried to provide as much detail as possible, as you requested, this failure is very special as it is my first xss reflected
     I accept suggestions on how to improve my attacks and my reports, I will be grateful for any recommendations or feedback
     how I am providing my services from a professional point of view to bring security to systems that include thousands of users
     cleared of any attack via the vulnerable application
